# Shakespeare's Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Act II, Scene 2, spoken in the
# play by Prince Hamlet to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises, and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that
this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most
excellent canopy, the air—look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this
majestical roof fretted with golden fire—why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work
is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving
how express and admirable! In action how like an angel, in apprehension how
like a god! The beauty of the world. The paragon of animals. And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me. No, nor woman neither,
though by your smiling you seem to say so.

Recently, though I don’t know why, I’ve lost all sense of fun, stopped
exercising—the whole world feels sterile and empty. This beautiful canopy
we call the sky—this majestic roof decorated with golden sunlight—why,
it’s nothing more to me than disease-filled air. What a perfect invention
a human is, how noble in his capacity to reason, how unlimited in thinking,
how admirable in his shape and movement, how angelic in action, how godlike
in understanding! There’s nothing more beautiful. We surpass all other animals.
And yet to me, what are we but dust? Men don’t interest me, Women neither,
but you’re smiling, so you must think they do.
